Over the course of the semester, I served as a Co-Instructor for 530.343: Design and Analysis of Dynamical Systems in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins. This was my first time serving as a Co-Instructor, and I loved it. Teaching dynamical systems, and watching students have those “it clicks” moments, has quickly become one of my favorite parts of academic life. I truly enjoy teaching!
