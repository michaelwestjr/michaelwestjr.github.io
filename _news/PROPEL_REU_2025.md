Over the course of the summer, I had the opportunity to advise Jay Childs (Howard University) and Caly Ferguson (UMBC) on a project in which they designed and built an elbow exoskeleton to advance my research on impedance perception. It was an honor to work with such talented young researchers, and I’m excited to see where their paths lead next. Whatever they pursue, I know they’ll do great things!
