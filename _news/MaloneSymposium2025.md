Over the past year, I had the opportunity to advise Taliyah Huang on a project investigating humans’ ability to perceive damping using visual observation alone. She presented this work at the [the 9th Annual Johns Hopkins Research Symposium on Engineering in Healthcare, “Human + AI: Redefining the Standard of Care in Medicine](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/2025-symposium/). Taliyah did an outstanding job communicating complex ideas with clarity and confidence, and it was exciting to see her represent our work so well. The feedback we received was incredibly encouraging, and I’m looking forward to pushing this project toward publication so we can share the findings with the broader community.
