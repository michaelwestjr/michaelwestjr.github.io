I attended the the 2025 Summer School for Neurorehabilitation (SSNR) in baiona, Spain! I got to present my work ["The Study of Dexterous Hand Manipulation: A Synergy-Based Complexity Index"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10844894) and ["Role of path information in visual perception of joint stiffness"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010729) and connected with an amazing group of researchers while exploring the beautiful countryside.
