I attended the 2025 International Consortium for Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR) in Chicago. Federico Tessari presented our paper titled ["A Geometric Approach for the Comparison of Kinematic Synergy Postures"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11063213). Anway Pimpalkar presented our paper titled ["Optimizing Cross-Modal Matching for Multimodal Motor Rehabilitation"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11063112). This paper was a finalist for best paper award!
