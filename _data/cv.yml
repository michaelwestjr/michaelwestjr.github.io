  - "Dr. West's research, rooted in control theory, advances robotic technologies such as rehabilitation robotics, collaborative robots, prosthetics, and dexterous robots by investigating human motor control, learning, and perception. Combining expertise in controls, robotics, biomechanics, and neuroscience, I develop simple, descriptive motor control models that offer immediate and easily interpretable insight. Introducing novel analysis methods for human motor control and leveraging established approaches on new experimental paradigms, my work consistently uncovers fresh insights on human motor control, learning, and perception."
