<h3>Michael West’s Journey to Dr. Michael West, PhD</h3>
This talk was presented to students in the Johns Hopkins University [Promoting Research Opportunities in Engineering Labs (PROPEL) Program](https://engineering.jhu.edu/about/outreach-and-belonging/hopkins-engineering-propel/) on June 25, 2025. PROPEL is JHU’s summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, which provides students with hands-on research opportunities and mentorship in engineering.

I shared my path from undergraduate student to Ph.D., using the “river people vs. mountain people” analogy to highlight how different personalities navigate academic journeys. I also offered practical advice on choosing a graduate school and how to thrive once there: (1) by not getting discouraged by failure, **Shoot your shot!**, and (2) honoring the person who matters most, *yourself*.

<h3>Navigating the Faculty Interview Process: Advice for Candidates</h3>
This talk was presented to Memebers of the Johns Hopkins Postdoctoral Research Association on February 18, 2025. I shared practical guidance on preparing for the faculty job market, including how to approach written applications, virtual and in-person interviews, and the negotiation stage. The session focused on helping candidates communicate a clear research vision, **generate excitement** about their work, and navigate the process with confidence and strategy.

<h3>Undergraduate Research as a Launchpad: Insights from a Post-doctoral Fellow</h3>
This talk was presented at the Johns Hopkins University Advisor Open House on August 13, 2025, with audience members from the greater Baltimore community. I shared my journey from undergraduate researcher to postdoctoral fellow, discussed my current work on human motor control and perception in the Haptics and Medical Robotics (HAMR) Lab, and highlighted the diverse career paths of recent lab graduates. The goal of the talk was to show how early research experiences can shape long-term academic and professional trajectories.
